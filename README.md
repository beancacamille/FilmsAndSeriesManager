# FilmsAndSeriesManager
## Project Overview
### Project Description
Films and Series Manager is an application that helps a user keep track of the shows that he/she is watching, planning to watch, and finished watching. The user can add shows and add them to favourites, add scores, and also add notes. Furthermore, the user can use the search and filter functionality to easily navigate his/her list.
### Project Goals
- The project development must be implemented using Agile.
- The application must have a user interface, a business layer, a database, and a test layer. The database must have at least 2 linked tables.
- The project must include a clear and concise documentation.
- A final project demo is needed to be presented.

#### Sprint Review
The database was completed and scaffolded using Entity Framework. There were some changes made when implementing business layer methods.
The [assigning of genre](https://github.com/beancacamille/FilmsAndSeriesManager/projects/1#card-50354314) took a lot of time to implement because of the complexity of joining many-to-many tables using a link table but I was able to complete all the user stories in the sprint backlog.
#### Sprint Retrospective
I did not expect the [assigning of genre](https://github.com/beancacamille/FilmsAndSeriesManager/projects/1#card-50354314) to be quite complex so it took me a lot of time to think of how to implement it efficiently. Time-boxing each user story would be very effective for increasing productivity.
On the other hand, I am getting more familiar with staging, committing, and pushing files to Github.

#### Sprint Review
I managed to complete all of the planned user stories in the sprint backlog and I added more user stories for creating the interfaces of adding a film and showing category lists. My blocker for this sprint was figuring out how to switch between different WPF windows but I was able to work it out in the end.
#### Sprint Retrospective
I planned to time-box each user story for 30 minutes each but some of the user stories were quite easy to do and related to other user stories. Whereas some took a lot more to do than the allocated time, so I still need to work on my time-boxing technique. Other than that, I think I am more than halfway complete with my project. I just need to complete 2 more functionalities then I can do more unit testing and interfaces which I will add to my project backlog.
